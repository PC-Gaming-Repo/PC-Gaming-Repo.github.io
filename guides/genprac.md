Maintence is not something that should be obsessed over, but kept in mind. Overdoing things can screw up your PC just as much as doing nothing (mainly with drivers). 

### General Maintence (Windows)
  - DISM + SFC
    - Run CMD as admin, copy and paste "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth", and then "sfc /scannow"
    - This should be run after major updates, and *maybe* once a month or so
  
  - Drivers
    - For the love of god, do not use driver boosters, you dont need them
    - If there is nothing wrong with the computer, DO NOT UPDATE DRIVERS. 
    - GPU drivers are the only driver that needs to be updated, how often you update is up to you

### Things you should probably have. 
  - A spare USB drive
      Extremely helpful for troubleshooting and repairing/reinstalling the OS. Ventoy reccomended, MediCat optional.
