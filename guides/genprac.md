Maintence is not something that should be obsessed over, but kept in mind. Overdoing things can screw up your PC just as much as doing nothing (mainly with drivers). 

### General Maintence (Windows)
  - DISM + SFC
    - Run CMD as admin, copy and paste "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth", and then "sfc /scannow"
    - This should be run after major updates, and *maybe* once a month or so
  - Temp Files
    - Windows has its own "Disk Cleanup" utility, allowing you to delete among other things, temp files
    - Similarly, check monthly or so. If you are running out of disk space (this can be harmful to SSDs) then you should probably upgrade the drive or move programs off it.
  - Malware
    - Windows Defender is shockingly capable in its current state as an effective anti-virus. You dont really need a dedicated anti-virus, and you especially should not be paying for an anti=virus, much less using active scamming.
    - Like social engineering and hacking, once again humans are the weak point in the security. Education is far cheaper, and better for PC performance than active scanning. 
  
  - Drivers
    - For the love of god, do not use driver boosters, you dont need them
    - If there is nothing wrong with the computer, DO NOT UPDATE DRIVERS. 
    - GPU drivers are the only driver that needs to be updated, how often you update is up to you

### Things you should probably have. 
  - A spare USB drive

      Extremely helpful for troubleshooting and repairing/reinstalling the OS. Ventoy reccomended, MediCat optional - [Link](https://pc-gaming-wiki.github.io/#usb-booting--imaging)
  - Compressed Air

      Generally a good idea to have for cleaning the PC and keyboard. Can be bought in store, or use an air compressor.
  - A backup target

      Anything or anywhere that isnt your computer. Google Drive, Mega, an external hard drive are all good backups.
      Flash drives and sd cards should not be used as they are made of poor quality flash. All local media will suffer from "bit rot" if they go unsed for several months.
      Bit rot happens in SSDs that go unpowered as the voltage in the cells degrades due to internal resistance. With hard drives, a similar thing but with magnetism.
