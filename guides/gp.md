To be clear, none of this should be treated as a holy text, and should not be obsessed over, your OS will (usually) be fine without this. 

### General Maintence (Windows)
  - DISM + SFC
    - Run CMD as admin, copy and paste "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth", and then "sfc /scannow"
    - This should be run after major updates, and *maybe* once a month or so
  
  - Drivers
    - For the love of god, do not use driver boosters, you dont need them
    - GPU drivers are the only driver that needs to be updated, how often you update is up to you
