# Medicat 

Medicat includes important tools like a bootable Malwarebytes image, password removal, partitioning tools, as well as other live operating systems.
It comes with a massive collection of portable apps (even if many of them are redundant), and because its based on ventoy, you can use your own ISO/IMGs. 

## What youll need: 
- 32GB or larger USB drive
- 20 minutes, or longer depending on how fast or slow your internet is



### Downloading

READ: Before anything, disable defender. Medicats files include many programs detected as cracking tools and will make defender go crazy.
This can be done by searching "Tamper protection" in windows, and disabling real time protection.

1. Go to their [website](https://medicatusb.com/#downloads).

2. Download the installer for your OS.

3. The installer will give you the option to download the actual bulk of the files or you can do it manually

4. Select the usb drive when prompted, this process will delete all files on the usb drive.

5. Once finished, the drive is ready for use! Any ISOs you have will go in the "OSImages" folder.

These tools are more a "have and hope you dont need" as disaster recovery isnt fun.
